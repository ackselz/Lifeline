## UN Sustainable Development Goals & Targets
### SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being

> 3.2 - End all preventable deaths under 5 y/o
> 
> 3.4 - Reduce mortality from non-communicable diseases and promote mental health
> 
> 3.6 - Reduce road injuries and deaths
> 
> 3.c - Increase health financing and support health workforce in developing countries


- Choking is the 4th leading cause of unintentional death in children under 5. At least 1 child dies from choking every 5 days in the US with more than 12,000 children taken to A&E for such incidents.
- Mental disorders are among the leading causes of disability worldwide, with depression being the most common. NCDs disproportionately affect LDCs, with 85% of premature deaths occurring in these countries.
- 1 in 5 individuals involved in road accidents die due to delayed first-aid, and 2/3 of deaths occur within 25 min after trauma.
- Half the world's population lack access to essential health services. In LDCs, shortage of skilled health workers is a major barrier to providing adequate emergency response.


### SDG 4: Quality Education
> 4.7 - Education for sustainable development and global citizenship

- A survey by the British Red Cross found only 5% of adults have the knowledge and confidence to administer first aid in emergency situations. 
Furthermore, in LDCs, the lack of access to robust healthcare systems and trained healthcare workers makes basic first aid knowledge and skills
even more crucial in response to emergency situations. 
- Over 150,000 lives could be saved each year if more people were trained in basic first aid.
